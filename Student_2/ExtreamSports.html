                        <p>Mountaineering, also called mountain climbing, the sport of attaining, or attempting to
                            attain,
                            high points in
                            mountainous regions, mainly for the pleasure of the climb. Although the term is often
                            loosely
                            applied to walking
                            up low mountains that offer only moderate difficulties, it is more properly restricted to
                            climbing in
                            localities where the terrain and weather conditions present such hazards that, for safety, a
                            certain amount of
                            previous experience will be found necessary. For the untrained, mountaineering is a
                            dangerous
                            pastime.</p>

                        <p>Mountaineering differs from other outdoor sports in that nature alone provides the field of
                            action-and just about
                            all of the challenges-for the participant. Climbing mountains embodies the thrills produced
                            by
                            testing one's
                            courage, resourcefulness, cunning, strength, ability, and stamina to the utmost in a
                            situation
                            of inherent risk.
                            Mountaineering, to a greater degree than other sports, is a group activity, with each member
                            both supporting and
                            supported by the group's achievement at every stage. For most climbers, the pleasures of
                            mountaineering lie
                            not only in the “conquest” of a peak but also in the physical and spiritual satisfactions
                            brought about
                            through intense personal effort, ever-increasing proficiency, and contact with natural
                            grandeur.

                        <p>Parkour is the art of using one's body to maneuver around obstacles in a man-made or natural setting.
                            Without the aid of equipment, moving from one place to another quickly and efficiently may involve running,
                             vaulting, jumping, climbing, rolling, and other actions. The field was popularized through Internet videos, 
                             television commercials, documentaries, and feature films, such as the James Bond film Casino Royale, after 
                             it was first developed in France in the late 1980s (2006).</p>

                        <p>Parkour's roots may be traced back to Georges Hébert's "la méthode naturelle," or "natural method," of physical
                             education and training, which he developed starting in the years leading up to World War I. The exercise
                              program included "parcours du combattant," or obstacle courses, as well as instruction in sprinting,
                               jumping, climbing, balancing, swimming, and defending. The French military training eventually was
                                based on Hébert's approach. Raymond Belle later received training in Hébert's techniques while
                                 serving in the military, and he later used that education to become an expert fireman. This training 
                                 took place in the 1940s and 1950s. He was renowned for his athletic acrobatic abilities, which included 
                                 the ability to safely and quickly traverse along ledges, to scale buildings without the aid of a ladder,
                                  and to leap between building rooftops. David Belle, his son, is typically given credit.</p>

                        <p>Skydiving, also called parachuting, use of a parachute—for either recreational or competitive
                            purposes-to
                            slow a diver's descent to the ground after jumping from an airplane or other high place. The
                            sport traces
                            its beginnings to the descents made from a hot-air balloon by the French aeronaut
                            André-Jacques
                            Garnerin
                            in 1797, but modern skydiving is usually performed from a propeller-driven airplane.</p>

                        <p>At events such as the annual World Free Fall Convention in Quincy, Illinois, however,
                            parachutists are
                            afforded the opportunity to jump from such diverse craft as hot-air balloons, helicopters,
                            and a
                            Boeing 727.
                        </p>

                        <p>Furthermore, typical jump altitudes in modern times for experienced skydivers range from
                            7,500 to
                            15,000 feet
                            (2,300 to 4,600 metres) above ground level, yielding a freefall time of between 40 and 85
                            seconds.
                            The length of the freefall (the time between exiting the aircraft and deploying the
                            parachute)
                            is
                            dependent upon such factors as exit altitude, opening altitude, and fall rate. The fall rate
                            is
                            determined by the jumpsuit the skydiver wears and the way in which the suit conforms to the
                            body
                            during the freefall (a looser suit offers more resistance to the air and slows the fall) and
                            by
                            the diver's body configuration relative to the ground. </p>

                        <p>Hang gliding, sport of flying in lightweight unpowered aircraft which can be carried by the
                            pilot.
                            Takeoff is usually achieved by launching into the air from a cliff or hill. Hang gliders
                            were
                            developed by the pioneers of practical flight. In these early designs the pilot hung from
                            the
                            armpits on parallel bars beneath the wings, swinging hips and legs to control roll and
                            shifting
                            back and forth to influence pitch.</p>

                        <p>Modern hang gliding emerged toward the end of the 1960s. In the early 1960s enthusiasts in
                            California
                            were gliding down coastal dunes on homebuilt delta-shaped wings they had adapted from kite
                            designs
                            developed by Francis Rogallo and his wife, Gertrude. The Rogallos' kites had attracted
                            attention
                            because of NASA's interest in using them for spacecraft retrieval. On the dunes cheap
                            materials
                            such as bamboo and plastic sheeting were used, and the parallel-bar control method remained.
